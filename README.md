## Minimal Real-Time Simulation Sandbox

A small real-time simulation that visualises simple dynamical systems as moving points on a 2D canvas.
Designed as a lightweight, deterministic sandbox for experimenting with update loops, state evolution, and visualisation.

The project intentionally keeps dependencies minimal and avoids engine abstractions in order to make the simulation model and time-stepping behaviour explicit.
